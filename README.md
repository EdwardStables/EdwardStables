### Hi there!

I'm Ed (or Edward, just not Eddie), a hardware engineer working at Imagination Technologies. 

That profile picture is my dog Kagi. He's incredibly lazy and fantatastic foot warmer.

My Github contains a few personal projects, mostly for learning new technologies and ideas, and a bunch of university projects. 

I'm currently working on a few things:
- ![Advent of Code 2021](https://github.com/EdwardStables/AoC2021) - Having a great time completing this year's set of tasks. Trying to go as fast as possible in python without numpy (or similar).
- ![Bite](https://github.com/EdwardStables/Bite) - a simple Python library for making life easier when working with numbers in a hardware design/computer engineering setting. 
- A FizzBuzz implementation in hardware to try and get super high throughput, and to learn CocoTB. Repo to be made public when it is a little more complete.
- A very simple RISC-V implementation in hardware, on hold until the above project is done.

A few past highlights are:
- ![High performance derivative free numerical optimisation](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/DirectSearch.jl) (masters thesis)
- ![STUART, a robot designed to test human/machine interactions](https://github.com/EdwardStables/STUART) (a fun uni project)
- ![A software raytracer written in Julia](https://github.com/EdwardStables/julia_ray_tracing) (personal project to learn more about ray tracing)
