### Hi there!

I'm Ed (or Edward, just not Eddie), a hardware engineer working at Imagination Technologies. 

My Github contains a few personal projects, mostly for learning new technolgies and ideas, and a bunch of university projects. A few highlights are:

- ![High performance derivative free numerical optimisation](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/DirectSearch.jl) (masters thesis)
- ![STUART, a robot designed to test human/machine interactions](https://github.com/EdwardStables/STUART) (a fun uni project)
- ![A software raytracer written in Julia](https://github.com/EdwardStables/julia_ray_tracing) (personal project to learn more about ray tracing)
