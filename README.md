### Hi there!

I'm Ed, a hardware engineer working at Innosilicon developing GPU technology. 

I generally have a few ongoing personal projects, currently my main projects are an FPGA VGA driver (not yet public), and a ![VCD viewer](https://github.com/EdwardStables/pge_wave) using the fantastic ![olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

A few past highlights are:
- ![Advent of Code](https://github.com/EdwardStables/AoC)
- [The Weather Garden](https://themeaningofluff.itch.io/the-weather-garden). OneLoneCoder 2022 Code Jam Entry. Unfinished and buggy, but lots of fun to make.
- ![High performance derivative free numerical optimisation](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/DirectSearch.jl). My final year university project. 
- ![STUART](https://github.com/EdwardStables/STUART). A very enjoyable university final year group project, a robot designed to test human/machine interaction.
- ![Software raytracer](https://github.com/EdwardStables/julia_ray_tracing). A Julia implementation of The Ray Tracer Challenge.
